I played Tree World for a 151st/150th consecutive day today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> It costs over 1,505,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> My 139th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 130 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 26 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->

I raised my tree up 0 branches today, and made progress on the Treekeeper. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals.

I reached another treekeeper on 2022 April 27th, this one is incredibly expensive (3,103,540 tree food to pass, additional 120000+ for branch expansion) and is going to take me several days to pass.

I only did collection today. I did not raise my tree up at all, or rescue any critters. I will pass the treekeeper tomorrow.

I currently have 166 out of 301 critters, totaling 55.15% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 50/62 (80.65% of all types collected)

Uncommon: 53/65 (81.54% of all types collected)

Rare: 46/64 (71.87% of all types collected)

Legendary: 4/50 (08.00% of all types collected)

I raised my tree up 1.25 branches today (to branch 111) and finished the treekeeper. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals.

I did not go any rescue missions today, summon any critters, or open any critter capsules. I did rescue a critter from completing the treekeeper. It was a strawnose. I finally earned it back. Now to keep it.

I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals. It started waning further in 2022 May (mid-May) in which I have been having less sessions, and shorter sessions.

I did not go on any adventures, open any critter capsules, or summon any critters today.

I am spending vitagems faster than I can earn them. I tried to stay at 100 or more, but I am continuously dropping (end of session total: 90)

I currently have 168 out of 301 critters, totaling 55.81% of all critter types collected.

My 166th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 158 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 42 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level. 

I raised my tree up 0.5 branches (to branch 124) today, and placed 2 new critters on the tree. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals. It started waning further in 2022 May (mid-May) in which I have been having less sessions, and shorter sessions. It has since started to recover, as of late May 2022.

I did not go on any adventures, open any critter capsules, or summon any critters today.

I am spending vitagems faster than I can earn them. I tried to stay at 100 or more, but I am continuously dropping (end of session total: 66)

I currently have 168 out of 301 critters, totaling 55.81% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 54/62 (87.10% of all types collected)

I played Tree World for a 203rd/202nd consecutive day today. It costs over 2,150,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. My 182nd day starter critters leveled up today (to level 2) along with my day 174 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 57 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level.

I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today (to branch 130) and didn't place any critters on the tree. I was again surprised that there were still no tree keepers. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals. It started waning further in 2022 May (mid-May) in which I have been having less sessions, and shorter sessions. It has since started to recover, as of late May 2022. It has started to go away again in 2022, mid-June.

I did not summon any critters, open any critter capsules, or go on any adventures today.

My sessions were a little more consistent today.

I am spending vitagems faster than I can earn them. I tried to stay at 100 or more, but I am continuously dropping (end of session total: 64)

I currently have 169 out of 301 critters, totaling 56.14% of all critter types collected.

My 195th day starter critters leveled up today (to level 2) along with my day 187 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 70 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level.

I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals. It started waning further in 2022 May (mid-May) in which I have been having less sessions, and shorter sessions. It has since started to recover, as of late May 2022. It has started to go away again in 2022, mid-June, strengthening in late 2022, June. As of early July, it is starting to wane again.

I did not summon any critters, or go on any adventures today, but I did open a critter capsule, and unlocked my first `Fancy Rat` (rarity: `limited`)

My sessions were a lot less consistent today, I played a lot less today.

I am spending vitagems faster than I can earn them. I tried to stay at 100 or more, but I am continuously dropping (end of session total: 66)

I currently have 174 out of 301 critters, totaling 57.80% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 54/62 (87.10% of all types collected)

Uncommon: 52/65 (80.00% of all types collected)

Rare: 48/64 (75.00% of all types collected)

I played Tree World for a 232nd/231st consecutive day today. It costs over ~2,800,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. My day 208 starter critters leveled up today (to level 2) along with my day 200 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 83 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level.

I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today.

My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals. It started waning further in 2022 May (mid-May) in which I have been having less sessions, and shorter sessions. It has since started to recover, as of late May 2022. It has started to go away again in 2022, mid-June, strengthening in late 2022, June. As of early July, it is starting to wane again. On 2022 July 11th, I had my shortest session to date, playing for less than 6 minutes across the entire day. The next day, I had an even shorter session.

I did not summon any critters, open any critter capsules, or go on any adventures today.

Starting today (2022, July 21st) I am no longer uploading Tree World gameplay images to GitHub. This is part of a recent plan to transition images to a separate platform. Documentation is still planned on being included, along with the file structure.

My sessions were a lot less consistent today, I played a lot less today.

I am spending vitagems faster than I can earn them. I tried to stay at 100 or more, but I am continuously dropping (end of session total: 76)

I currently have 176 out of 301 critters, totaling 58.47% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 54/62 (87.10% of all types collected)

I played Tree World for a 244th/243rd consecutive day today. It costs over ~2,800,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. My day 220 starter critters leveled up today (to level 2) along with my day 212 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 95 critters to level 4 (max level)

I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today.

The in-app purchase section of the game ceased functionality 7 days ago (on 2022, Tuesday, July 26th) It appears the game servers are down for good. Luckily the game doesn't require an Internet connection to play.

My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals. It started waning further in 2022 May (mid-May) in which I have been having less sessions, and shorter sessions. It has since started to recover, as of late May 2022. It has started to go away again in 2022, mid-June, strengthening in late 2022, June. As of early July, it is starting to wane again. On 2022 July 11th, I had my shortest session to date, playing for less than 6 minutes across the entire day. The next day, I had an even shorter session.

I did not summon any critters today, or go on any adventures, but I did open a critter capsule, unlocking a second pteranodon (rarity: `rare`)

Starting 12 days ago (2022, July 21st) I am no longer uploading Tree World gameplay images to GitHub. This is part of a recent plan to transition images to a separate platform. Documentation is still planned on being included, along with the file structure.

My sessions were a bit more consistent today, I played for a little more time today.

I am spending vitagems faster than I can earn them. I tried to stay at 100 or more, but I am continuously dropping (end of session total: `75`)

I currently have 178 out of 301 critters, totaling 59.13% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 54/62 (87.10% of all types collected)

Uncommon: 52/65 (80.00% of all types collected)

Rare: 52/64 (81.25% of all types collected)

## Glitches

### Sky glitch

<!-- Notes 2021.12.17
Sky glitch (own section in status file) occurs at branch 35-41, occurs only when scrolling down, resets once you go back down to branch 33, if you go slow enough, the glitch doesn't trigger
!-->

The sky glitch seems to occur at around branches 35 to 41, and only activates when scrolling down. It cuts the background out at this range, and only shows blackness. It resets once you go back down to branch 33. If you go slow enough the glitch doesn't trigger.

**Observations as of 2021, Friday, December 17th**

The glitch seems to also happen if you open the navbar of your device, even if you aren't scrolling in the game.

**This observation is as of 2021, Sunday, December 26th**

### Critter duplication glitch

On 2021 Thursday December 23rd, I accidentally performed the critter duplication glitch by pressing the cancel button before it completely loaded. I got an extra Armadillo. I did not want to perform the glitch, I might evict the critter.

### Critter disappearing glitch

I have commonly noted that upon loading the game, several critters on branches don't load. You have to scroll past the branch and scroll back for them to reload. If you scroll midway, and back down, the critter will load as a white box (sprite) until you go off screen and come back.

This glitch is similar to the critter loading glitch, but is completely different from the critter deletion glitch.

### Critter loading glitch

See above: I don't know what causes this, but as of 2022 March 1st, upon loading the game, 1 critter has a watchclock icon but doesn't load until you scroll up and back down.

### Critter deletion glitch

I don't know what causes this, earlier on in my Tree World for Android days, one of my critters disappeared off my tree and never came back. I was unable to recover it.

On 2022, May 2nd, I earned it back. I hope it stays this way now.

## Potential glitches

### Vitagem-tree food swap glitch

I heard a rumor early on when I was playing this game again, noting that someone claimed there was a glitch where the game crashes, and your vitagems/tree food swap. It is not confirmed, however. I have not encountered it yet as of 2022 March 21st
